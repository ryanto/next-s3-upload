# Setup

## Installation

```bash
npm install next-s3-upload

# or

yarn add next-s3-upload
```

## Environment variables

You'll need to setup the following environment variables for this package to work correctly.

```bash
S3_UPLOAD_KEY=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
S3_UPLOAD_SECRET=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
S3_UPLOAD_BUCKET=name-of-s3-bucket
S3_UPLOAD_REGION=bucket-region-us-east-1
```

Next.js automatically supports [loading environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) from `.env.local` in the project's root. For development it's best to put these values into `.env.local`.

For production, you'll need to set these variables with your hosting provider. If you're using Vercel you can configure the [build step](https://vercel.com/docs/build-step#environment-variables) to use these variables.

In the next sections we'll go over how to generate values for these variables.

## S3 bucket

Create a new S3 bucket and store the name of the bucket as `S3_UPLOAD_BUCKET` and its region as `S3_UPLOAD_REGION` in your `.env.local` file.

### Bucket permissions

#### Public access

Once the bucket is created you'll need to go to the permissions tab and make sure that public access is not blocked.

![Bucket public access](/bucket-public-access.png)

#### Bucket policy

Next, you'll need to add the following bucket policy. Click the _Edit_ button in the _Bucket policy_ section and paste in the following policy.

![Bucket policy](/bucket-policy.png)

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Statement1",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

ðŸš¨ **Important** ðŸš¨ Before saving the policy, you'll need to replace:

|                 |                                                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **BUCKET_NAME** | The name of the bucket you created in the previous step. |
|                 |                                                          |

Save the policy to return to the bucket permissions screen.

#### CORS permissions

Next, you'll also need to add the following permissions in the CORS section.

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["PUT", "POST"],
    "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"]
  }
]
```

Here's what the CORS permissions will look like once you paste in the above JSON.

![Bucket cors](/bucket-cors.png)

These settings are required so users can upload files to your bucket.

## IAM user

Next, we'll need to create API keys that give your Next app access to AWS.

Go to the [IAM](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) section of AWS and add a new user with **Programmatic access**.

For the permissions step click _Attach existing policies directly_ and then click the _Create policy_ button.

![Create a policy](/create-a-policy.png)

When the policy editor opens, click on the _JSON_ tab and paste in the following policy.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "STSToken",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:GetFederationToken",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:sts::ACCOUNT_ID:federated-user/S3UploadWebToken"]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "S3UploadAssets",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME",
        "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*.jpg",
        "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*.jpeg",
        "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*.png",
        "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*.gif",
        "==== ADD OTHER FILE FORMATS HERE ====",
        "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*.format"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

ðŸš¨ **Important** ðŸš¨ Before saving the policy, you'll need to replace:

|                 |                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **ACCOUNT_ID**  | Your AWS account ID. You can get this number by clicking on your name in the header. It's the number next to My account. |
| **BUCKET_NAME** | The name of the bucket you created in the previous step.                                                                 |
|                 |                                                                                                                          |

### Allowed file formats

The example above only allows `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, and `gif` files to be uploaded. If you're planning to use `next/image` with files uploaded to S3 you'll want to make sure that only images are allowed to be uploaded.

If you're not using `next/image`, you can edit the above example and add additional file formats. For example, you can add `arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*` to allow any file to be uploaded.

### Save the policy

Next, click review policy, and name the policy `next-s3-upload`. The name doesn't matter, so feel free to use anything you'd like. Follow any prompts and create the policy.

Now go back to the tab where you were adding a user. Search for the policy you created and select it. If the policy doesn't show up click the refresh button.

![Refresh policy](/refresh-policy.png)

Select the policy and continue creating the user. You can just click through the next steps, there's no more configuration.

Once the user is created you'll see a screen with their API keys. Copy these keys to `.env.local` as `S3_UPLOAD_KEY` and `S3_UPLOAD_SECRET`.

![API keys](/api-keys.png)

That's it! We're done configuring AWS for uploads.

## API Route

In order for our Next app to securely communicate with S3 we'll need to create an API route. Paste the following into `pages/api/s3-upload.js`.

```js
// pages/api/s3-upload.js
export { APIRoute as default } from "next-s3-upload";
```

That's it. This module's `APIRoute` takes care of all the communication with S3.

You're now ready to [start uploading](/basic-example) files to your S3 bucket!
