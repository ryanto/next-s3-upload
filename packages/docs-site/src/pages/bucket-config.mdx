# Bucket config

This library works best when you set the following environment variables:

```text
S3_UPLOAD_KEY=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
S3_UPLOAD_SECRET=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
S3_UPLOAD_BUCKET=name-of-s3-bucket
S3_UPLOAD_REGION=us-east-1
```

Once these ENVs are set no other configuration is needed. Next-s3-upload will automatically read these ENVs when uploading files.

## Using other ENVs

If you cannot define the environment variables from the previous section, you can create your own and pass them into the API route:

```js
// pages/api/s3-upload.js
import { APIRoute } from "next-s3-upload";

export default APIRoute.configure({
  accessKeyId: process.env.CUSTOM_ENV_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  secretAccessKey: process.env.CUSTOM_ENV_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
  bucket: "bucket-name",
  region: "us-east-1"
});
```

Remember to always store your `accessKeyId` and `secretAccessKey` in environment variables. It's a security risk to check-in the plain text version of these keys when using version control. Environment variables work best because they keep the actual values out of commit history.

## Bucket endpoint

You can also set the bucket endpoint using the API route. This is only needed if you are using a non-AWS host.

```js
// pages/api/s3-upload.js
import { APIRoute } from "next-s3-upload";

export default APIRoute.configure({
  // ..
  endpoint: "https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com"
});
```

Now your upload will work with any S3 compatible web host.
