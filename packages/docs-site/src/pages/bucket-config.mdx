# Bucket config

This library works best when you set the following environment variables:

```text
S3_UPLOAD_KEY=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
S3_UPLOAD_SECRET=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
S3_UPLOAD_BUCKET=name-of-s3-bucket
S3_UPLOAD_REGION=us-east-1
```

Once these ENVs are set no other configuration is needed. Next-s3-upload will automatically read these ENVs when uploading files.

## Using other ENVs

If you cannot define the environment variables from the previous section, you can create your own and pass them into the API route:

```js
// pages/api/s3-upload.js
import { APIRoute } from "next-s3-upload";

export default APIRoute.configure({
  accessKeyId: process.env.CUSTOM_ENV_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  secretAccessKey: process.env.CUSTOM_ENV_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
  bucket: "bucket-name",
  region: "us-east-1"
});
```

Remember to always store your `accessKeyId` and `secretAccessKey` in environment variables. It's a security risk to check-in the plain text version of these keys when using version control. Environment variables work best because they keep the actual values out of commit history.

## Bucket endpoint

You can also set the bucket endpoint as well as the path style using the API route. This is only needed if you are using a [non-AWS host](/other-providers).

```js
// pages/api/s3-upload.js
import { APIRoute } from "next-s3-upload";

export default APIRoute.configure({
  // ..
  endpoint: "https://my.endpoint",
  forcePathStyle: true
});
```

Now your upload will work with any S3 compatible web host.

## Dynamic Bucket configuration

Bucket configuration can be dynamic based on request data.
This is useful if you want to upload files to different buckets in the same AWS account depending on the request or some other criteria.

Warning: We recommend not using this feature to set bucket name via Request body as that could lead to security issues.
Instead, ensure the bucket name is still set from predicated values within the function.

```js
// pages/api/s3-upload.js
import { APIRoute } from "next-s3-upload";

export default APIRoute.configure({
  // ..
  async bucketName(req) {
    const { uploadType } = req.body;
    const bucket =
      uploadType === S3UploadType.public
        ? process.env.S3_PUBLIC_BUCKET
        : process.env.S3_PRIVATE_BUCKET;

    // May extend to more options
    return bucket;
  },
});
```
